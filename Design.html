        <p>
          <strong>Design Challenge 1: Water Consumption</strong> (April - May
          2024)<br />
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> Increase water consumption among health
            insurance clients.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Process:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Conducted comprehensive research to understand hydration habits
                and barriers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Engaged users through interviews, surveys, and observations.
              </li>
              <li>Analyzed data to identify key user needs and pain points.</li>
              <li>
                Ideated, prototyped, and iteratively tested innovative
                solutions.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Outcome:</strong> My team and I developed a low-fidelity
            prototype of a smart water bottle using play dough, featuring
            temperature control, hydration tracking, reminders, and a location
            tracker. The bottle connects to a phone app for notifications and
            personalized hydration goals, ensuring users always have water with
            them.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> User Research, Data Analysis,
            Ideation, Prototyping, Testing, Team Collaboration, Problem-Solving,
            Design Thinking, Utilizing Miro for Visual Collaboration, Effective
            Communication, Empathy Mapping
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />

          <strong>Design Challenge 2: Reimagining Dental Care</strong>
          (Feb-March 2024)<br />
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> Understand how people currently feel
            about going to the dentist to identify areas of improvement that
            will encourage annual check-ups.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Process:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Conducted comprehensive research to understand patients'
                feelings and pain points regarding dental visits.
              </li>
              <li>
                Engaged users through interviews, surveys, and observations.
              </li>
              <li>Analyzed data to identify key user needs and pain points.</li>
              <li>
                Ideated and iterated on potential solutions to improve the
                dental visit experience.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>User Insights:</strong> People are nervous about going to
            the dentist, find insurance coverage important, face financial pain
            points, experience stress in booking appointments, and struggle to
            find a new dentist due to too many options.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Project Insight:</strong> We learned that reducing waiting
            times and enhancing financial transparency would encourage more
            regular dental visits.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Recommendations:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Ensure transparent and concise billing every visit.</li>
              <li>
                Offer easier online booking to check availability and increase
                accessibility.
              </li>
              <li>Enhance the waiting room experience.</li>
