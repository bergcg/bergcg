              Welcome! I’m Caroline, a Boston College graduate with a degree in
              Computer Science and a minor in Marketing. Driven by my passion
              for design and technology, I currently work as a UX Designer and
              Digital Strategist, collaborating with a small business owner to
              enhance website user experience, build online presence, and
              support digital marketing efforts through content creation and
              social media. I’m passionate about combining creativity and
              technology to craft user-centered, intuitive solutions. Outside of
              work, you’ll find me painting, hiking, hunting for unique
              treasures at thrift stores, attending concerts, or enjoying a
              weekend camping trip.

            <p>
              This project explores the relationship between technology and
              children's education. The research was spearheaded by Prof. Damian
              Bebell of the Lynch School of Education and I was able to use the
              raw data to analyze and draw insights. Created on Glitch, I used
              D3 and VegaLite to create interactive and information
              visualizations of a survey dataset. The project developed my
              ability to translate complex data into easy-to-understand insights
              for users.

              >
            </li>
            <p>
              In this project I was able to practice using Tableau, a data
              visualization software. Using the same dataset from the
              <a href="data-article.html" style="color: #483f7a"
                >Data Driven Article</a
              >, I began by asking questions and making visualizations in hopes
              of finding insights. I compiled my insights into story bits and
              then created a narrative using the dahsboard feature in Tableau.

            <p>
              This project consisted of two parts. The first was designing a
              static visualization to represent any finding from a dataset on
              Boston College's enrollment. The second part was the redesign an
              existing visualization from 1958 to make it more clear and
              understandable by viewers.

          <h3>Web App Development</h3>

              >
              <p>
                The goal of this project was to develop a web application to
                tackle the real-world problem of students needing reliable and
                cost-effective access to textbooks. Our solution was a website
                where students can buy and sell textbooks to peers within their
                university, addressing the high costs and resale difficulties
                students face.

                >Exercises with React, HTML, CSS, Javascript</a
              >
              <p>
                I learned how to build websites using React, HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript. With React, I created dynamic and responsive user
                interfaces. HTML and CSS helped me structure and style web
                pages, while JavaScript added interactivity to my projects.
                Overall, the course taught me how to develop engaging and
                functional web applications.

            </li>
            <p>
              With a team, I completed various design challenges where we sought
              to find user-centered solutions to given problems. We followed the
              design thinking model of empathizing with users, defining problem
              statements, ideating innovative solutions, prototyping concepts,
              and iteratively testing them for refinement.

              >
            </li>
            <p>
              I was tasked with creating a complete online storefont. My goal
              was to make a (fake) bakery website that was cohesive,
              professional, and sleek. I took this marketing course in Quito,
              Ecuador so I was able to practice the Spanish language while
              creating this website.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <h3>Customer Research and Insights for Marketing Decisions</h3>

              >
            </li>
            <p>
              In a semester-long case study, my team and I studied the
              competition between Lyft and Uber in the rideshare market. Our
              research, focus groups, and surveys revealed important insights
              which led us to create recommendations for Lyft's success.
